I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. I received my PhD in Economic Sociology from the MIT Sloan School of Management. I conduct computational social science research, with a focus on analyzing large-scale online user behavior, network dynamics, and language data. In one stream of research, I use natural language processing and social network analyses to examine online communities as increasingly important organizational forms that offer new contexts for work, innovation, and communication and connection more broadly. In a second stream of research, I use primarily qualitative methods to study how collaboration is changing in the face of evolving communications technologies. For my dissertation work, I was selected as a finalist in the 2023 INFORMS/Organization Science Dissertation Proposal Competition.
