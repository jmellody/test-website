I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. I received my PhD in Management from MIT Sloan, with a focus on computational social science.

In my primary stream of research, I study user dynamics on online communities, leveraging a broad array of analytical techniques including causal inference, network analysis, and natural language processing. In a second stream of research, I use mixed methods to study how collaboration is changing in the face of evolving communications technologies.
