  <p>
    I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the 
    <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Center for Information Technology Policy
    </a> 
    at Princeton University. I received my PhD from 
    <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      MIT Sloan
    </a>, with a focus on computational social science.

    In my primary stream of research, I study user behavior and dynamics in large-scale online communities, leveraging a broad array of quantitative methods including causal inference, network analysis, and natural language processing. In a second stream of research, I use mixed methods to study how collaboration is changing with new communication technologies.
